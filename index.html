		<h1>Tupac Shakur</h1>
		<p><strong> Me Againts the World</strong></p><br><br>
		<p> Can you picture my prophecy?<br>
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me<br>
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin<br>
There ain't no stoppin me<br>
Constantly movin while makin millions<br>
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings<br>
Can't raise the children cause they're killin<br>
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin<br>
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?<br>
Hard headed bastard<br>
Maybe he'll listen in his casket - the aftermath<br>
More bodies being buried - I'm losing my homies in a hurry<br>
They're relocating to the cemetary<br>
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried<br>
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me<br>
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers<br>
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger<br>
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is<br>
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth<br>
It's just me against the world baby</P><br><br><br>
		<p>Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself<br>
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy<br>
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin<br>
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy<br>
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child<br>
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while<br>
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw<br>
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall<br><br>

Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less<br>
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin<br>
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving<br>
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up<br>
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka<br>
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin<br>
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking<br>
When I gets to pervin, so what?<br>
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales<br>
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well</P><br><br>
		<p>With all this extra stressin<br>
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath<br>
When will I finally get to rest? Through this supression<br>
They punish the people that's askin questions<br>
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions<br>
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons<br>
Don't settle for less - even a genius asks-es questions<br>
Be grateful for blessings<br>
Don't ever change, keep your essence<br>
The power is in the people and politics we address<br>
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic<br>
And when you get stranded<br>
And things don't go the way you planned it<br>
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference<br>
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen<br>
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change<br>
It wasn't nuttin like the game<br>
It's just me against the world<br>

Me against the world<br><br>

Nuttin to lose<br>
It's just me against the world baby<br><br>

Me against the world<br><br>

Got me stuck in the game<br>
It's just me against the world<br></p><br>
